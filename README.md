# Movie Recommender System
![Preview](image.png)

## Project Overview

This project encompasses the development of a Movie Recommender System, involving data preprocessing, model building, and the creation of a web-based interface using Streamlit. The entire process includes the following steps:

1. **Data**: Obtain and preprocess the data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Keep relevant columns, obtain required values, and concatenate them into a string (tag) for model input.
3. **Model**: Build and train the recommender model.
4. **Website**: Develop a Streamlit-based web application for user interaction.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the system to make recommendations accessible.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing step involves selecting relevant columns, extracting required values, and forming a string (tag) for model input. This ensures the data is ready for training the recommender model.

## Streamlit App

The Streamlit web application allows users to interact with the Movie Recommender System. It includes features such as selecting a movie and receiving recommendations based on the trained model.
